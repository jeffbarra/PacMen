This is one of the first major projects that I completed in my MIT xPro journey.  This game utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Copy and paste these files into VS Code, run within "live-server" and enjoy the game!  Future improvements include: more animated PacMen, a "stop" button, a "resume/restart" button and the ability to click on each PacMan character in order to stop it from moving.
